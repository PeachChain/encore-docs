title: "Configure the SDK"
---

As soon as your app launches, you need to configure the SDK with your **API Key**. You'll retrieve this from the Encore Dashboard.

---

## Initialize Encore in Your App

Begin by editing your main application entry point. Depending on your app architecture, this could be your `AppDelegate.swift` for UIKit apps or your main `App` struct for SwiftUI apps.

### SwiftUI

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Encore

@main
struct YourApp: App {
    init() {
        // Configure Encore with your API key
        Encore.shared.configure(apiKey: "pk_your_api_key_here")
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

### UIKit

```swift
// AppDelegate.swift

import UIKit
import Encore

@main
final class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        // Configure Encore with your API key
        Encore.shared.configure(apiKey: "pk_your_api_key_here")
        return true
    }
}
```

This configures a shared instance of `Encore`, the primary class for interacting with the SDK's API. Make sure to replace `pk_your_api_key_here` with your public API key.

<Note>
If you don't have access to your API key, please contact your Encore representative.

## What Happens During Configuration

When you call `configure()`, the SDK:

1. **Initializes the API client** - Sets up secure communication with Encore servers
2. **Creates the Signal Manager** - Ensures reliable delivery of grant signals
3. **Sets up Entitlement Manager** - Prepares the hybrid entitlement system
4. **Loads cached data** - Restores any previously saved entitlement state

---

## Verify Configuration

After configuration, you should see log messages in your console:

```
ðŸ”§ [Encore] Environment: production
âœ… [Encore] SignalManager initialized for reliable grant signal delivery
âœ… [Encore] EntitlementManager initialized for hybrid entitlement tracking
```

If you see these messages, you've successfully configured Encore! ðŸŽ‰

---

## Next Steps

Now that Encore is configured, you're ready to:

- [Identify Users](./user-management) - Learn how to identify users for entitlement tracking
- [Check Entitlements](./checking-entitlements) - Start checking user entitlements in your app
- [Present Offers](./presenting-offers) - Show promotional offers to your users
