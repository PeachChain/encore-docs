## Overview

The Encore SDK is distributed as a **private Swift Package**. You'll receive a GitHub Personal Access Token from the Encore team to authenticate and install the package.

---

## Prerequisites: Obtain Access Credentials

You should have received the following from the Encore team:

- **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/PeachChain/encore-swift-sdk`
- **Access Token:** A GitHub Personal Access Token (starts with `ghp_...`)

<Note>
**Don't have credentials?** Contact us in your dedicated support channel

## Install via Swift Package Manager

Swift Package Manager is Apple's official dependency manager integrated into Xcode.

### Step 1: Add Package in Xcode

1. In **Xcode**, select **File ▸ Add Packages...**
2. Paste the **private repository URL**:
   ```
   https://github.com/PeachChain/encore-swift-sdk
   ```
3. Press Return or click the search icon
4. When prompted for credentials, enter:
   - **Username:** `encore-sdk` (or any text - doesn't matter)
   - **Password:** Paste the **access token** provided by Encore
   - Check **"Remember my choice"** to avoid re-entering

### Step 2: Configure Dependency

With the **encore-swift-sdk** package selected:

1. Set **Dependency Rule** to **Up to Next Major Version**
2. Set the lower bound to **1.0.0**
3. Make sure your project is selected in **Add to Project**
4. Click **Add Package**

### Step 3: Add to Target

After the package resolves:

1. Ensure **Add to Target** is set to your app's name
2. Click **Add Package**

### Step 4: Verify Installation

You should now be able to import the SDK:

```swift
import Encore
```

**✅ Installation complete!**

## Advanced Topics

<Accordion title="CI/CD Configuration">

If you're using continuous integration, you'll need to configure authentication in your CI environment.

**GitHub Actions**

Add the Encore-provided access token as a repository secret:

1. Go to your repository **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `ENCORE_GITHUB_TOKEN`
4. Value: The access token provided by Encore
5. Add to your workflow YAML:

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3

- name: Configure Git credentials for Encore SDK
  run: |
    git config --global url."https://${{ secrets.ENCORE_GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/PeachChain/".insteadOf "https://github.com/PeachChain/"

- name: Resolve Swift dependencies
  run: xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -project YourApp.xcodeproj
```

**Xcode Cloud**

1. Go to **App Store Connect → Your App → Xcode Cloud**
2. Navigate to **Settings → Environment**
3. Add a new secret environment variable:
   - **Name:** `ENCORE_GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - **Value:** The access token provided by Encore
4. Add a custom build script (`ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh`) to configure Git:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
git config --global url."https://${ENCORE_GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/PeachChain/".insteadOf "https://github.com/PeachChain/"
```

**Bitrise / CircleCI / Other CI**

Add the token as an environment variable and configure Git:

```bash
# Add to your build script
git config --global url."https://${ENCORE_GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/PeachChain/".insteadOf "https://github.com/PeachChain/"

# Then run your build
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies
```
